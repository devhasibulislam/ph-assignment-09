        "question": "What is Context API or describe purpose of Context API?",
        "answer": "In React we usually send data from one component to another. In that case the data of one component has to be sent to another child component as props. Often the situation is that the child component is much lower than our main component where your data is. That means that data component has another child component, again that child component has another child component. There may be many children doing this. It can be said to be like digging up data. We usually use Redux in such situations or the situation may be more complicated than that. In that case we have a global status that any child can access later if they want, without having to pass all the components as props and take data."

        "question": "What is the difference between Inline Block and Block elements?",
        "answer": "The inline-level elements need no new line is required to start the inline element and this element will only occupy the width as required. Inside the paragraph element <span> is an inline element. Example of inline element: <span> (Span element) <a> (Anchor element) <img> (image element) but using 'Inline-Block' make the inline element to behave like a block element and The block-level element always starts with a new line. Occupies the full width of that line (extending from left to right as much as possible). <div> A block-level element Example of block-level element: <div> (div element) <h1> - <h6> (Heading Element) <p> (paragraph element) <form> (form element). Long story short: inline-block elements contain only require spaces where block elements contain the whole area as needed or not."
