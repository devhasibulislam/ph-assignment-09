        "question": "What is Context API or describe purpose of Context API?",
        "answer": "In React we usually send data from one component to another. In that case the data of one component has to be sent to another child component as props. Often the situation is that the child component is much lower than our main component where your data is. That means that data component has another child component, again that child component has another child component. There may be many children doing this. It can be said to be like digging up data. We usually use Redux in such situations or the situation may be more complicated than that. In that case we have a global status that any child can access later if they want, without having to pass all the components as props and take data."
